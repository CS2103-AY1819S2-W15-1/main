== PROJECT: Fashion Match

---

== Overview

Fashion Match is a desktop apparels matching application that recommends user the appropriate combination of apparels based on their the apparels they owned. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to sort the apparels based on a given option; such as sorting by name, colour or clothing type*
** What it does: allows the user sort the apparels in any valid way. To find out about the valid way of sorting, user can simply type `sort options` which output all the valid sorting options.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might want to arrange the apparels in a certain order for easy viewing.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation taps on existing command. Truly adopt the spirit of "Don't reinvent the wheel".
** Credits: _Pending_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a <name of command> command that allows the user to <Do what>.
